\chapter{Experimental Data Processing}
\label{ch:exp_process}

\textbf{Module Path:} \texttt{src/exp\_process/}

This module implements the full preprocessing and fitting pipeline for raw experimental surface and curve measurements. It replaces both the previous \texttt{Exp\_Data} and \texttt{Preprocess} modules with a more structured, object-oriented architecture designed to be extended for new experiment types with minimal changes to existing code.

Previously, \texttt{Exp\_Data} handled physical dimensions and sample configuration while \texttt{Preprocess} ran separate per-experiment scripts for cleaning, fitting, and visualization. These responsibilities are now unified under \texttt{exp\_process}, with the processing logic reorganized into reusable, experiment-agnostic layers. Sample dimensions and simulation configuration remain in separate modules outside \texttt{exp\_process} (see \texttt{data/input/}).

The module handles two distinct experiment types, each with their own geometry and data format:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experiment 1 (T-Shape):} 3D surface measurements from a T-shaped specimen, acquired in multiple passes (\texttt{bottom} and \texttt{wall} regions) across two measurement sides. Multiple measurements per side are averaged during parsing.
    \item \textbf{Experiment 2 (Rectangular Profile):} 1D curve measurements from a rectangular specimen, acquired in two opposing directions (Left/Right). The L/R pair is averaged and merged into a single profile during parsing, before any further processing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Architecture}

The module is organized into five layers, each with a well-defined responsibility. Data flows top-to-bottom through these layers, with configuration injected at the pipeline level.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parsers (\texttt{parsers/}):} Read raw \texttt{.txt} files from disk and return structured NumPy arrays. One parser class per experiment type.
    \item \textbf{Core (\texttt{core/}):} Stateless mathematical and geometric utilities — cleaning, fitting, meshing, transforming, segmenting, and reconstructing. These classes have no knowledge of file paths or experiment types.
    \item \textbf{Procedures (\texttt{procedures/}):} Orchestrate the core utilities into named pipeline stages: \texttt{preprocess}, \texttt{fitting}, \texttt{comparison}, and \texttt{validation}. Each procedure reads from and writes to disk as JSON.
    \item \textbf{Pipeline (\texttt{pipeline/}):} High-level entry points that chain procedures together. A user runs the pipeline; the pipeline calls the procedures in order.
    \item \textbf{Utils \& GUI (\texttt{utils/}, \texttt{gui/}):} JSON I/O helpers and the interactive point cloud viewer used in the validation step.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dependencies}

The module depends on standard scientific Python libraries. All are listed in \texttt{src/exp\_process/deps\_core.py} and \texttt{deps\_gui.py}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core:} \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{shapely}, \texttt{scipy} (implicit via \texttt{numpy.linalg})
    \item \textbf{GUI:} \texttt{matplotlib} (TkAgg backend), \texttt{tkinter}
\end{itemize}
