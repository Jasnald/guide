\section{Stage 2: Analytical Stress Field Generation}
\label{sec:ep_field_gen}

\textbf{Script:} \texttt{s2\_RE\_Field.py}

This script generates a synthetic residual stress field for validation or initial condition setup. It creates a defined stress distribution (typically cylindrical) based on the geometric limits of the mesh.

\subsection{Functionality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mesh Generation:} 
    Based on the coordinate limits ($x_{min}, x_{max}, \dots$) extracted from the model information, it generates a homogeneous cloud of points to represent the material volume.
    
    \item \textbf{Stress Calculation:} 
    It computes the geometric center of the component and calculates stress components ($\sigma_{xx}, \sigma_{yy}, \dots$) analytically relative to this center. This is useful for creating benchmark fields when experimental data is unavailable.
\end{itemize}
