\label{ch:introduction}

This software suite is designed to process, analyze, and visualize 3D measurement data obtained from surface scanning of physical samples, specifically T-shaped metal specimens. The toolkit addresses common challenges in metrology data processing, including noise reduction, outlier detection, surface fitting, and 3D reconstruction.

\section{Purpose}

Raw measurement data from coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) or optical scanners typically contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measurement noise and systematic errors
    \item Thousands of unstructured data points
    \item Inconsistencies between multiple measurements
\end{itemize}

This toolset provides a systematic workflow to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clean and organize raw measurement data
    \item Fit mathematical surface models to point clouds
    \item Generate statistical analysis and visualizations
    \item Reconstruct regularized surface models for further analysis or simulation
\end{enumerate}
