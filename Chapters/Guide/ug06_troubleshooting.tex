\section{Troubleshooting \& Advanced Usage}
\label{sec:guide_trouble}

\subsection{Common Issues}

\begin{description}
    \item[Error: "Abaqus command not found"] \hfill \\
    The pipeline cannot find the solver. Edit \texttt{config.json} manually or via GUI and ensure \texttt{"abaqus\_cmd"} points to the full path of your batch file (e.g., \texttt{C:/SIMULIA/Commands/abq2021.bat}).

    \item[Simulation Hangs / Convergence Failure] \hfill \\
    Check the \texttt{.msg} file in the simulation directory. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If "Too many increments": Increase \texttt{maxNumInc} in the GUI.
        \item If "Time increment too small": Your mesh might be too distorted. Try a larger \texttt{Mesh Size} in the DOE settings.
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Missing HDF5 Files] \hfill \\
    This usually means the Abaqus Python extraction failed. Check if you have write permissions in the directory or if the disk is full.
\end{description}

\subsection{Advanced: Customizing Geometry}
To analyze a shape other than the standard T-part:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Edit \texttt{src/Exp\_Data/s1\_exp/mean\_dim.py} to update the physical dimensions.
    \item Run \texttt{attempt.py} manually once to verify the new geometry builds correctly in Abaqus CAE before running the full batch.
\end{enumerate}
