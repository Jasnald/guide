\section{Results Conversion Pipeline}
\label{sec:pl_conversion}

\textbf{Script:} \texttt{converters.py}

While the \texttt{Conversor} module (Part I) contains the low-level logic for handling data formats, this script acts as the high-level trigger within the automation pipeline. It orchestrates the multi-stage process of transforming proprietary Abaqus results into open formats.

\subsection{Two-Stage Execution}
The \texttt{ResultConverter} class manages the bridge between the different Python environments required for extraction:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Abaqus Extraction (Python 2.7):} 
    The method \texttt{\_run\_abaqus\_extraction} triggers the \texttt{ODB\_2\_XDMF.py} script using the configured Abaqus command line. It wraps the call in an \texttt{AbaqusScriptRunner}, ensuring the proprietary ODB API is accessed correctly to dump raw data into NPY files.
    
    \item \textbf{XDMF Compilation (Python 3.x):} 
    Immediately after extraction, the method \texttt{\_run\_npy\_to\_xdmf} invokes the \texttt{NpyBatchToXdmfConverter}. Since this runs in the modern pipeline environment, it efficiently compiles the raw arrays into hierarchical HDF5 files ready for visualization.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pipeline Integration}
This converter is designed to be called at the end of a simulation workflow (e.g., inside \texttt{cm\_main.py}). It takes a \texttt{method\_type} (like "Contour Method") as an argument to correctly route the output files to their specific directories.
