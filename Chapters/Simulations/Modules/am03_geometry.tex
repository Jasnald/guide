\section{Geometry Construction Strategies}
\label{sec:am_geometry}

\textbf{Package:} \texttt{\_modules/geometry/}

Implements the CAD logic of the framework using a \textbf{Strategy Pattern}: each simulation type has its own sub-package with a \texttt{GeometrySetter} class that exposes a single \texttt{\_geometry(depth)} method returning a \texttt{(model, t\_part)} tuple. \texttt{BaseAnalysis} calls this via the abstract \texttt{\_get\_geometry\_setter()} method, so adding a new geometry requires only a new sub-package implementing that interface.

\subsection{Strategy 1: T-Shape (\texttt{sim\_one})}
Generates the standard T-profile benchmark geometry.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{\_get\_shape.py} — \texttt{ShapeGetterI}:} Returns a dictionary of T-profile dimensions (\texttt{h\_width}, \texttt{h\_thickness}, \texttt{v\_width}, \texttt{v\_height}, \texttt{offset\_1}).
    \item \textbf{\texttt{\_set\_geometry.py} — \texttt{GeometrySetter}:} Draws an 8-point closed polygon on a \texttt{ConstrainedSketch} using \texttt{PolygonDrawer} and extrudes it with \texttt{BaseSolidExtrude(depth=comprimento)} to produce \texttt{T\_Shape\_Part}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategy 2: Milling Profile (\texttt{sim\_two})}
Handles the Profile Analysis (Exp2 / milling) geometry with different orientation requirements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{\_get\_shape2.py} — \texttt{ShapeGetterII}:} Provides the specialised vertex coordinates for the milling profile.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{\_set\_geometry2.py} — \texttt{GeometrySetterTwo}:} Same sketch-and-extrude pattern as Sim One but with coordinates and model name specific to the milling setup.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategy 3: Rectangular Block (\texttt{sim\_three})}
\textbf{\texttt{\_set\_geometry3.py} — \texttt{GeometrySetterThree}:} Creates a simple rectangular prism (\texttt{width} × \texttt{height} × \texttt{depth}). Used for coupon-level validation cases where no complex cross-section is needed.

\subsection{Strategy 4: Inverted T-Shape (\texttt{sim\_iv})}
\textbf{\texttt{\_set\_geometry4.py} — \texttt{GeometrySetterIV}:} Produces an inverted T cross-section (flange at the bottom, web extending upward) with a fixed 25\,mm flange width and a parametric web width/height. The web is centred via offset $\texttt{ofs} = (25 - \texttt{width})/2$.
